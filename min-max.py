# Description: Write a program that asks the user how many integers they would like to enter.  You can assume they will
# enter an integer >= 1.  The program will then prompt the user to enter that many integers.  After all the numbers
# have been entered, the program should display the largest and smallest of those numbers (no, you cannot use arrays,
# or any other material we haven't covered).  When you run your program it should match the following format:
number = int(input("How many integers would you like to enter"))
i = 0
print("Please enter", number, "integers.")
maxi = 0
mini = 0
while number != maxi:
    i > maxi
    i < mini

    if i < maxi:
        i += 1
        maxi = i
        print("max: ", maxi)
        if i > mini:
            i += 1
            mini = i
        print("min: ", mini)
